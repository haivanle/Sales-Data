Data Analysis for Sales KPI Setting
The original dataset is from Sample_Order raw. There are not enough data to analyze customers but I think they are sufficient enough to get an idea
of how the company is performing. I tried hard to segment customers based on their Return, Frequency, and Spending Scores. Hope this helps with
your case test.
Warm regards,
